REQUIREMENTS:
1. OpenCV
2. Tensorflow
3. numpy
use python main.py or python3 main.py to run it the 1.tflite should be in the same directory inorder for it to work you guys can switch between original and cartoonstic one using the following keys:
O = original camera
c = cartoonstic filtered camera
q = to quit the camera.

I have used more than 2 days to make this project. with the help of youtube tutorial and debugging thorugh AI too.

what does this project do:
converts live camera fotage to cartoon one as you guys can see in the demo
you guys can use your own trained module if its .tflite then it would be too easy just replacing the file name and for other file types as long as it supports or you guys can also use tutos ai if it didnt worked..;)
